1. INTRODUCTION

Csubstitute opens the current quickfix list in an editable buffer so you can
change each entry’s text by hand and apply those edits back to the source
buffers in one write. It keeps entries in quickfix order, enforces the same
line count, and warns if the underlying file changed unexpectedly.

==============================================================================
2. COMMANDS

:Csubstitute [cmd]
  Open or reuse the [csubstitute] buffer. Optional {cmd} is any window command
  (for example: vertical split, tabnew); defaults to a split.

:Csubstitute! [cmd]
  Same as above, but closes any quickfix or location list windows when opening
  the buffer.

:Csub [cmd] / :Csub! [cmd]
  Shorthand forms of the above.

==============================================================================
3. BEHAVIOR

  - One line per quickfix entry, in quickfix order.
  - Inline virtual-text metadata shows filename and “| line:col |” padded to a
    fixed width; the line text itself stays editable.
  - Line count is enforced: adding or deleting lines restores the previous
    state and shows a warning, keeping a 1:1 mapping with the list.
  - Writing the buffer applies edits:
      • Entries without a bufnr: quickfix text is updated only.
      • Entries with a bufnr: the file line is replaced if the original text
        still matches; if the file changed and differs from your edit, a
        warning is shown and that line is left untouched.
      • Buffers are saved with :update unless 'hidden' and g:csubstitute_no_save
        are set, in which case they are only marked listed.
  - After applying, the quickfix list is refreshed and focus returns to
    [csubstitute].
  - If no quickfix list exists, an info notice is shown and nothing opens.

==============================================================================
4. OPTIONS

g:csubstitute_no_save
  When non-zero and 'hidden' is set, modified buffers touched during apply are
  marked listed instead of being written with :update.

==============================================================================
5. NOTES

  - Window-local defaults for the Csub buffer include nowrap; extend
    apply_window_opts in lua/csubstitute/init.lua to add more per-window
    settings.
  - The plugin is manual: use :cdo or :cfdo for command-driven automated edits;
    use Csubstitute when you want to hand-edit each entry.

==============================================================================
6. WORKFLOW EXAMPLE

  1) Populate quickfix (for example: :grep, :make).
  2) :Csubstitute
  3) Edit lines in [csubstitute].
  4) :w to apply edits back to the source buffers and quickfix list.
